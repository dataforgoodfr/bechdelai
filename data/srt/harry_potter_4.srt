1
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,543
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:38,676
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:43,222
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,603
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:51,230
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,690
I only meant...

7
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:55,818
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,363
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,075
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:04,911
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:09,040
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,251
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:14,671
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:29,894
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:33,731
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:39,237
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:41,239
Avada Kedavra!

18
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:47,745
Harry.

19
00:03:48,497 --> 00:03:50,164
Harry!

20
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,251
Are you all right?

21
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:56,087
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:59,590
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:01,009
Last night.

24
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:03,428
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:04,846
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:06,556
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,017
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:12,520
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:22,030
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,783
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:27,452
Keep up!

32
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,873
Arthur!

33
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,042
It's about time, son.

34
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:38,588
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:44,427
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:47,238
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,473
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,308
This way.

39
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:55,396
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:58,316
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:00,276
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:05,573
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,660
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:10,995
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:15,333
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,669
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:21,339
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:22,840
Time to go!

49
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:24,634
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:28,846
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

51
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:30,098
...three!

52
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:42,276
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:45,029
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:59,669
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:03,214
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:11,139
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,893
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:21,566
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,360
Look!

60
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,530
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:35,830
Blimey!

62
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:37,874
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,417
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:40,918
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:42,753
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:49,468
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:52,805
What?

68
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,106
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:03,608
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:06,277
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:09,280
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:11,949
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:14,368
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:17,788
I love magic.

75
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:36,557
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:39,977
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:41,562
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,522
If it rains...

79
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,067
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:49,195
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:52,657
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:54,992
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,286
There's no need with these people.

84
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:02,291
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:04,502
While you can.

86
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:22,561
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,605
Come on!

88
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:28,818
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,820
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:39,370
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

91
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,836
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:54,260
Who's that?

93
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:58,055
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,644
Krum! Krum! Krum!

95
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,608
Krum!

96
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:11,527
Yes!

97
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:21,162
Good evening!

98
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:24,707
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,960
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:32,340
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:38,387
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:40,389
Let the match...

103
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,350
...begin!

104
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:50,649
Krum! Krum! Krum!

105
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:00,159
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:01,952
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,164
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:08,250
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:09,794
He's an artist.

110
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:12,254
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:13,798
Viktor, I love you

112
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:15,591
Viktor, I do

113
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,969
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

114
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:21,806
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,724
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,851
It's not the Irish.

117
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:29,146
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:33,651
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:37,154
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:39,990
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:42,326
Go!

122
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:44,328
Harry!

123
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:01,303
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

124
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:04,682
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:53,856
Morsmordre!

126
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:22,092
Harry!

127
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:26,805
- Where are you?
- Harry!

128
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:30,684
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,604
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,440
What is that?

131
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:41,612
Stupefy!

132
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,113
Stop!

133
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:45,491
That's my son!

134
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:49,203
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:50,663
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,998
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,167
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:57,378
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:59,046
What crime?

140
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:01,715
It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.

141
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,050
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:08,097
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:10,474
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,560
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:13,311 --> 00:13:17,314
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,149
There!

147
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:21,652
All of you, this way!

148
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:23,821
A man, Harry?

149
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,573
Who?

150
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:27,783
I don't know.

151
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:31,620
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:55,102
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,774
Anything from the trolley, dears?

154
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:03,152
Packet of Drooble's...

155
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,112
...and a Licorice Wand.

156
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:08,657
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

157
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:12,828
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

158
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,498
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

159
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,505
Thank you.

160
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:26,342
Anything sweet for you, dear?

161
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:29,511
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

162
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:32,431
Anything from the trolley?

163
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,642
This is horrible.

164
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:37,728
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

165
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:39,688
Wasn't there any security or...?

166
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:42,650
Loads, according to Dad.

167
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:46,779
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

168
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:52,826
It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.

169
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:54,662
I'm fine.

170
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:59,583
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

171
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:03,754
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

172
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,391
Hedwig. There we go.

173
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:56,849
Clear the runway!

174
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:05,023
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

175
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:33,927
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

176
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:38,348
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

177
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:41,685
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

178
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,688
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

179
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:47,107
Yes, what is it?

180
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:48,692
What is it?

181
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,364
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

182
00:16:54,532 --> 00:17:00,496
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

183
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:02,706
The Triwizard Tournament.

184
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,334
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

185
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:08,670
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

186
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,964
...for a series of magical contests.

187
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:14,676
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

188
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:16,553
Now let me be clear.

189
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:19,640
If chosen, you stand alone.

190
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:21,725
And trust me when I say...

191
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:24,895
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

192
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:29,525
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

193
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:33,737
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

194
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:37,908
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

195
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,005
Bloody hell.

196
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:02,182
Blimey. That's one big woman.

197
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:26,290
And now our friends from the north.

198
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:29,293
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

199
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,296
...and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.

200
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,904
Oh, it's Krum!

201
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:58,530
Blimey, it's him!

202
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:00,574
Viktor Krum!

203
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,918
Albus.

204
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:12,836
Igor.

205
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:17,736
Hogwarts! Let's entertain our friends
in the best way we can!

206
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:19,236
All Stand!

207
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,036
Maestro, please!

208
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:25,636
<i>Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</i>

209
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:28,936
<i>Teach us something please</i>

210
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:31,736
<i>Whether we be old and bald</i>

211
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:35,036
<i>Or young with scabby knees</i>

212
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:38,436
<i>Our heads could do with filling</i>

213
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:41,436
<i>With some interesting stuff</i>

214
00:19:41,536 --> 00:19:44,736
<i>For now they're bare and full of air</i>

215
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:48,036
<i>Dead flies and bits of fluff</i>

216
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:06,303
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

217
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,014
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

218
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:12,726
Our gatekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

219
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:15,146
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

220
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,023
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

221
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:25,906
You idiot!

222
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:32,913
Your attention, please!

223
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,418
I'd like to say a few words.

224
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,255
Eternal glory.

225
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,718
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

226
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:50,097
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

227
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:54,226
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

228
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:55,644
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

229
00:20:55,812 --> 00:21:00,065
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

230
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,609
To explain all this...

231
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:05,404
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

232
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:07,740
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

233
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,882
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

234
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:28,844
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

235
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:32,473
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

236
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:36,310
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

237
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,825
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

238
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:53,118
Thank you.

239
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,502
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

240
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,922
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

241
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:13,847
After due consideration...

242
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:16,892
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

243
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,020
...no student under the age of 17...

244
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:23,941
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

245
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,819
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

246
00:22:26,987 --> 00:22:29,571
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

247
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:33,492
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

248
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:55,306
The Goblet of Fire.

249
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,767
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

250
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:01,854
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

251
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:05,107
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

252
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,444
Do not do so lightly.

253
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,406
If chosen, there's no turning back.

254
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:17,536
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

255
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,773
Alastor Moody.

256
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,318
Ex-Auror...

257
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,447
...Ministry malcontent...

258
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:56,075
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

259
00:23:56,242 --> 00:24:00,704
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

260
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,623
Any questions?

261
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:07,544
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

262
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:11,590
...I believe in a practical approach.

263
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:17,471
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

264
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:20,307
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

265
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:23,727
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

266
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:28,023
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

267
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:30,943
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

268
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:34,571
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

269
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,907
You need to be prepared.

270
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,535
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

271
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:41,995
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

272
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:45,165
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

273
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,668
And hear across classrooms!

274
00:24:50,004 --> 00:24:53,507
So which curse shall we see first?

275
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:54,883
- Weasley!
- Yes?

276
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,385
Stand.

277
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:01,348
Give us a curse.

278
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:05,352
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

279
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,187
The Imperius Curse.

280
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:10,691
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

281
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:13,735
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

282
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,697
Perhaps this will show you why.

283
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,664
Hello.

284
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,001
Lovely little beauty.

285
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,131
Engorgio.

286
00:25:34,507 --> 00:25:36,175
imperio!

287
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:43,015
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

288
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:50,856
If she bites...

289
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:52,900
...she's lethal.

290
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:57,237
What are you laughing at?

291
00:25:58,573 --> 00:25:59,990
Get off!

292
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,203
Talented, isn't she?

293
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,748
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

294
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:11,126
Drown herself?

295
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:26,183
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

296
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:30,354
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

297
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,773
...under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.

298
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:34,858
But here's the rub:

299
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,195
How do we sort out the liars?

300
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,241
Another, another.

301
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:44,785
Up, up. Come on.

302
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:46,495
Longbottom, is it?

303
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:48,664
Up.

304
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:54,586
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

305
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:58,131
There's the...

306
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:00,300
The Cruciatus Curse.

307
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:03,303
Correct, correct. Come, come.

308
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:05,138
Particularly nasty.

309
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:10,018
The torture curse.

310
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,188
Crucio!

311
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,705
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

312
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:51,351
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

313
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:55,105
No?

314
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:58,442
Avada Kedavra!

315
00:28:02,196 --> 00:28:03,739
The Killing Curse.

316
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:08,035
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

317
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:10,954
...and he's sitting in this room.

318
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,321
Brilliant, isn't he?

319
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,533
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

320
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:51,970
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

321
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:54,623
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

322
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:58,919
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

323
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,298
Neville?

324
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:04,925
Son?

325
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:06,927
You all right?

326
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:11,264
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

327
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,781
We're gonna be late!

328
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,714
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

329
00:29:59,313 --> 00:30:01,815
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

330
00:30:01,983 --> 00:30:04,651
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

331
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:06,445
Yeah, rather you than me.

332
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:08,530
Yes!

333
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,659
Thank you, thank you.

334
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:15,871
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

335
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:18,206
It's not going to work.

336
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,918
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

337
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:25,046
You see this? This is an Age Line.

338
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:27,007
Dumbledore drew it himself.

339
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:28,633
So?

340
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:33,847
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

341
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:37,017
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

342
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:41,438
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

343
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:45,192
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

344
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,194
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

345
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,532
- Yes!
- Yes!

346
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:54,868
Yeah!

347
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:57,662
Yes!

348
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,581
Ready?

349
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:05,045
- Yes!
- Yes!

350
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:15,555
- You said!
- You said!

351
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:19,935
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

352
00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:22,604
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

353
00:31:22,772 --> 00:31:24,231
Fight! Fight! Fight!

354
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,071
We're "old school," right?

355
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:33,615
Yeah, but you look older!

356
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:07,649
Sit down. Please.

357
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,947
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

358
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:16,241
The champion selection.

359
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:51,484
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

360
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,836
The champion for Beauxbatons...

361
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:12,005
...is Fleur Delacour.

362
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,560
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

363
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:40,033
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

364
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:44,371
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

365
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:47,874
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

366
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:51,211
...this vessel of victory...

367
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:53,588
...the Triwizard Cup!

368
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,037
Harry Potter.

369
00:34:28,124 --> 00:34:29,749
Harry Potter?

370
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,339
No. No.

371
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,133
Harry Potter!

372
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:40,093
Go on, Harry.

373
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,012
Harry, for goodness sake.

374
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:14,711
He's a cheat!

375
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:17,797
He's not even 17 yet!

376
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:49,162
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

377
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,332
- Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
- Quiet! I can't think!

378
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,501
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

379
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:55,835
- Harry.
- I protest!

380
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:57,879
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

381
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:00,215
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

382
00:36:00,382 --> 00:36:01,716
- ...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

383
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:04,803
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

384
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,472
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

385
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:10,016
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

386
00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:13,353
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

387
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:15,522
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

388
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:18,691
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

389
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:22,028
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

390
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:25,281
- ...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

391
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:29,369
Leave this to you, Barty.

392
00:36:30,704 --> 00:36:32,914
The rules are absolute.

393
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:37,877
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

394
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,589
Mr. Potter has no choice.

395
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,717
He is, as of tonight...

396
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:48,555
...a Triwizard champion.

397
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,626
This can't go on, Albus.

398
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:21,796
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

399
00:37:21,964 --> 00:37:23,965
What do you suggest, Minerva?

400
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:27,218
Put an end to it.

401
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,679
Don't let Potter compete.

402
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,307
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

403
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:35,310
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

404
00:37:35,477 --> 00:37:37,937
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

405
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:42,108
Headmaster, l, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

406
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:46,196
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

407
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:49,949
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

408
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,119
...let them unfold.

409
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:55,455
What...? Do nothing?

410
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,290
Offer him up as bait?

411
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:01,127
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

412
00:38:02,004 --> 00:38:04,756
I agree. With Severus.

413
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:08,134
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

414
00:38:08,427 --> 00:38:10,887
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

415
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:14,265
He must be anxious enough as it is...

416
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:17,477
...knowing what lies ahead.

417
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:20,396
Then again, we all are.

418
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:37,080
How did you do it?

419
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:43,169
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.

420
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:46,673
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

421
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,217
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

422
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:51,302
Okay?

423
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,972
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

424
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:57,684
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

425
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,356
I didn't put my name in that cup.

426
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,610
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

427
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:13,866
Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

428
00:39:14,034 --> 00:39:15,243
It just did.

429
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,704
Okay?

430
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:28,256
Piss off.

431
00:39:43,272 --> 00:39:45,732
What a charismatic quartet.

432
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,693
Hello.

433
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,113
I'm Rita Skeeter.

434
00:39:52,698 --> 00:39:55,199
I write for the Daily Prophet.

435
00:39:55,784 --> 00:40:00,496
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

436
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,874
You're the juicy news.

437
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:07,253
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

438
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:10,923
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

439
00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:14,302
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

440
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,513
In short, what makes a champion tick?

441
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:22,310
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

442
00:40:22,478 --> 00:40:24,979
So who's feeling up to sharing?

443
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:30,902
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

444
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:44,957
This is cozy.

445
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,251
It's a broom cupboard.

446
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:49,921
You should feel right at home, then.

447
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,882
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

448
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,634
No.

449
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:56,969
So tell me, Harry.

450
00:40:57,137 --> 00:41:00,056
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

451
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,724
I'm 14. Sorry.

452
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,852
...about to compete
against three students...

453
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,314
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

454
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:11,067
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

455
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,569
...in your dizziest daydreams.

456
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,114
Concerned?

457
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:20,118
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

458
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:22,161
Just ignore the quill.

459
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:25,164
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

460
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:27,917
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

461
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:30,837
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

462
00:41:31,004 --> 00:41:34,257
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

463
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,175
No, I didn't enter.

464
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:37,969
Of course you didn't.

465
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:41,848
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

466
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:45,685
Scratch that last.

467
00:41:46,478 --> 00:41:50,648
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

468
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:52,608
Proud? Or concerned...

469
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:56,612
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

470
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,365
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

471
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:05,455
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

472
00:42:37,738 --> 00:42:40,072
Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.

473
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,534
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

474
00:42:43,702 --> 00:42:45,912
...and she's too easily recognized.

475
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,956
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

476
00:42:49,124 --> 00:42:53,294
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

477
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:55,254
And make sure you're alone.

478
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:56,923
Sirius.

479
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,591
P.S.:

480
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:00,551
The bird bites.

481
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:12,313
Sirius?

482
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,123
Harry Potter, age 12...

483
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:34,252
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

484
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:37,004
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

485
00:43:37,172 --> 00:43:38,756
...and choking back tears...

486
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,816
Sirius. How...?

487
00:43:56,984 --> 00:43:59,485
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

488
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:02,613
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

489
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:04,240
No!

490
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:06,117
I had to ask.

491
00:44:06,285 --> 00:44:11,080
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

492
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,666
But who was the third man in the room?

493
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:16,335
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

494
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,713
No.

495
00:44:19,631 --> 00:44:23,342
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

496
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,844
And what was that?

497
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:28,639
He wanted...

498
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:30,474
...me.

499
00:44:31,018 --> 00:44:35,354
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

500
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:38,816
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

501
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:40,818
Yes.

502
00:44:40,986 --> 00:44:42,528
It's just a dream.

503
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,697
Look, Harry.

504
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:48,367
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

505
00:44:48,535 --> 00:44:52,538
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

506
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:53,789
What are you saying?

507
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:58,210
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

508
00:44:58,378 --> 00:45:02,798
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

509
00:45:03,216 --> 00:45:08,387
Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

510
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:15,269
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

511
00:45:15,437 --> 00:45:17,730
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

512
00:45:17,898 --> 00:45:21,901
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

513
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:25,571
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

514
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:31,494
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

515
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,123
Who were you talking to?

516
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:39,377
- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

517
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:43,631
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

518
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,510
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

519
00:46:13,453 --> 00:46:15,079
Amazing.

520
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,751
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

521
00:46:21,294 --> 00:46:22,712
Right, sorry.

522
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:26,590
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

523
00:46:26,758 --> 00:46:29,927
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

524
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,139
It's already been through enough people.

525
00:46:33,306 --> 00:46:35,433
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

526
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:39,228
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

527
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,480
What do you want me to say again?

528
00:46:41,648 --> 00:46:42,982
Go.

529
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:50,114
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

530
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:54,285
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

531
00:46:54,453 --> 00:46:56,871
Is that right? Well, you...

532
00:46:57,038 --> 00:46:58,122
What?

533
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:06,172
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

534
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:11,927
Dean was told by Parvati that...

535
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,389
Please don't ask me to say it again.

536
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,224
Hagrid's looking for you.

537
00:47:17,726 --> 00:47:20,811
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

538
00:47:31,364 --> 00:47:33,616
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

539
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,368
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

540
00:47:36,536 --> 00:47:37,953
You'll see soon enough.

541
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,331
Now pay attention, this is important.

542
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,542
What's with the flower?

543
00:47:44,544 --> 00:47:46,962
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

544
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,089
As a matter of fact, I have.

545
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:52,468
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

546
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:02,436
Hagrid?

547
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:08,234
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

548
00:48:14,783 --> 00:48:18,202
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

549
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:22,081
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

550
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:24,917
...you had forgotten me.

551
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:27,086
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

552
00:48:27,712 --> 00:48:29,547
What is it you wanted to show me?

553
00:48:31,216 --> 00:48:34,426
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

554
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:36,262
...exhilarated.

555
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,682
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

556
00:48:50,277 --> 00:48:52,027
Can we get closer?

557
00:48:59,828 --> 00:49:01,287
Dragons?

558
00:49:01,454 --> 00:49:02,955
That's the first task?

559
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,416
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

560
00:49:06,668 --> 00:49:09,712
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

561
00:49:10,797 --> 00:49:12,298
Oh, crikey!

562
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:17,803
Although, I have to admit,
that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.

563
00:49:18,096 --> 00:49:20,931
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

564
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:24,476
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

565
00:49:24,644 --> 00:49:28,147
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

566
00:49:28,315 --> 00:49:29,773
Didn't Ron tell you that?

567
00:49:31,693 --> 00:49:33,110
No, he didn't.

568
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,696
He didn't tell me a thing.

569
00:49:45,665 --> 00:49:48,751
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

570
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,922
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

571
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,758
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

572
00:49:56,843 --> 00:49:58,510
Like the badge?

573
00:49:59,054 --> 00:50:00,804
Excuse me.

574
00:50:04,976 --> 00:50:06,435
Harry.

575
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,979
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

576
00:50:09,147 --> 00:50:10,648
Can I have a word?

577
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,484
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

578
00:50:13,652 --> 00:50:16,654
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

579
00:50:19,157 --> 00:50:21,700
Dragons. That's the first task.

580
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:25,037
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

581
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:27,206
Are you serious?

582
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:31,043
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

583
00:50:31,211 --> 00:50:33,462
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

584
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,089
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

585
00:50:35,256 --> 00:50:37,758
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

586
00:50:37,926 --> 00:50:40,970
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

587
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:43,555
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

588
00:50:44,265 --> 00:50:45,724
It just happens a fair bit.

589
00:50:45,892 --> 00:50:48,978
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

590
00:50:49,145 --> 00:50:50,980
You're a right foul git, you know that?

591
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:53,399
- You think so?
- I know so.

592
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:54,900
Anything else?

593
00:50:55,068 --> 00:50:58,570
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

594
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:04,576
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

595
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,746
My father and I have a bet, you see.

596
00:51:07,914 --> 00:51:11,083
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

597
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,588
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

598
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:19,925
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

599
00:51:20,885 --> 00:51:24,888
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

600
00:51:25,765 --> 00:51:28,392
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

601
00:51:30,562 --> 00:51:33,439
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

602
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:37,443
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

603
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,361
- Professor Moody!
- ...back-shooting...

604
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:42,448
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

605
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:47,619
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

606
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:55,169
Stand still! Stand still!

607
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:08,348
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

608
00:52:08,516 --> 00:52:10,476
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

609
00:52:10,643 --> 00:52:12,478
Professor!

610
00:52:12,645 --> 00:52:16,231
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

611
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:19,109
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

612
00:52:19,277 --> 00:52:23,072
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

613
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,449
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

614
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:30,454
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

615
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:32,998
Away!

616
00:52:36,127 --> 00:52:38,337
You. Come with me.

617
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,624
That's a Foe-Glass.

618
00:53:16,376 --> 00:53:18,544
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

619
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,340
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

620
00:53:27,512 --> 00:53:29,972
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

621
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,182
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

622
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:34,143
Now...

623
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:38,647
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

624
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:44,862
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

625
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:47,823
Sit.

626
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:52,911
Listen to me, Potter.

627
00:53:53,913 --> 00:53:55,080
Your pal Diggory?

628
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:59,751
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

629
00:54:00,879 --> 00:54:02,129
Miss Delacour?

630
00:54:02,547 --> 00:54:05,257
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

631
00:54:05,758 --> 00:54:09,344
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

632
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,680
...but Karkaroff's is not.

633
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,682
They'll have a strategy.

634
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,394
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

635
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,734
Come on, Potter.

636
00:54:23,902 --> 00:54:25,986
What are your strengths?

637
00:54:27,572 --> 00:54:28,947
I don't know.

638
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:31,909
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

639
00:54:32,076 --> 00:54:36,121
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

640
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:39,917
You're allowed a wand.

641
00:54:46,341 --> 00:54:47,799
Bets! Place your bets!

642
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:50,135
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

643
00:54:50,303 --> 00:54:53,263
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

644
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:56,308
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

645
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:57,976
Yes, sir?

646
00:54:58,311 --> 00:55:01,021
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

647
00:55:01,522 --> 00:55:03,482
Your attention, please.

648
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:06,318
This is a great day for all of us.

649
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:13,992
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

650
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,828
Please keep your seats at all times.

651
00:55:16,996 --> 00:55:19,748
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

652
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:23,335
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

653
00:55:23,503 --> 00:55:25,212
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

654
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,465
- How are you feeling? Okay?
- ...the greatest of luck.

655
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,179
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

656
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:36,181
Battle a dragon.

657
00:55:40,478 --> 00:55:42,980
Young love.

658
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,940
How...

659
00:55:47,402 --> 00:55:48,694
...stirring.

660
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:54,533
If everything goes unfortunately today...

661
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:57,494
...you two may even
make the front page.

662
00:55:57,662 --> 00:55:59,871
You have no business here.

663
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:02,082
This tent is for champions...

664
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:04,126
...and friends.

665
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:11,091
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

666
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,055
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

667
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:21,393
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

668
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:24,813
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

669
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,107
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

670
00:56:28,401 --> 00:56:30,068
Sorry, I'll just go.

671
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:31,862
Barty, the bag.

672
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:34,448
Champions, in a circle around me.

673
00:56:34,615 --> 00:56:37,743
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

674
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:41,830
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

675
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,416
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

676
00:56:48,504 --> 00:56:50,172
The Welsh Green.

677
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:56,136
Mr. Krum.

678
00:56:59,098 --> 00:57:01,016
The Chinese Fireball.

679
00:57:07,482 --> 00:57:09,900
The Swedish Short-Snout.

680
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,361
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

681
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:14,780
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

682
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,619
The Hungarian Horntail.

683
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:25,916
These represent four
very real dragons...

684
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:29,127
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

685
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:31,797
Your objective is simple:

686
00:57:31,964 --> 00:57:33,465
Collect the egg.

687
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:36,635
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

688
00:57:36,803 --> 00:57:40,305
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

689
00:57:40,473 --> 00:57:41,807
Any questions?

690
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:45,477
Very well. Good luck, champions.

691
00:57:45,645 --> 00:57:48,480
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

692
00:57:57,115 --> 00:58:00,951
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

693
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:15,882
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

694
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:19,553
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

695
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:23,223
And now our fourth and final contestant.

696
00:58:25,184 --> 00:58:28,770
Harry! Harry! Harry!

697
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,798
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

698
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,343
Accio Firebolt!

699
01:00:10,331 --> 01:00:12,499
- Yeah!
- Yes!

700
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:22,842
Oh, my God.

701
01:00:32,478 --> 01:00:35,814
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

702
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,968
Yes! Yes!

703
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:35,869
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

704
01:03:36,036 --> 01:03:37,996
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

705
01:03:38,164 --> 01:03:39,914
- Never!
- Never!

706
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:43,334
Shush!

707
01:03:43,836 --> 01:03:46,504
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

708
01:03:47,506 --> 01:03:50,341
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

709
01:03:51,177 --> 01:03:53,678
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

710
01:04:04,857 --> 01:04:07,275
What the bloody hell was that?

711
01:04:11,405 --> 01:04:14,157
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

712
01:04:14,325 --> 01:04:18,369
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

713
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:25,543
I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

714
01:04:25,878 --> 01:04:28,588
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

715
01:04:29,715 --> 01:04:31,841
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

716
01:04:32,009 --> 01:04:34,260
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

717
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:39,724
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

718
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:44,062
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

719
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:45,688
No, no, no, I did.

720
01:04:45,856 --> 01:04:48,900
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

721
01:04:49,068 --> 01:04:53,112
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

722
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,242
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

723
01:04:58,244 --> 01:05:01,246
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

724
01:05:01,455 --> 01:05:03,456
...after you'd figured that out.

725
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,501
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

726
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:08,586
That's completely mental.

727
01:05:08,754 --> 01:05:11,798
Yeah. Isn't it?

728
01:05:11,966 --> 01:05:14,008
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

729
01:05:16,595 --> 01:05:18,304
Boys.

730
01:05:42,788 --> 01:05:44,205
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

731
01:05:47,835 --> 01:05:50,461
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

732
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,092
Shush.

733
01:05:56,802 --> 01:05:58,136
Look at this!

734
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:02,640
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

735
01:06:03,684 --> 01:06:05,935
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

736
01:06:06,103 --> 01:06:08,855
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

737
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,316
Her latest prey, sources report...

738
01:06:11,483 --> 01:06:15,111
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

739
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:19,324
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

740
01:06:20,701 --> 01:06:22,660
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

741
01:06:22,828 --> 01:06:24,329
Thank you, Nigel.

742
01:06:29,126 --> 01:06:31,961
Not now, Nigel. Later.

743
01:06:33,797 --> 01:06:35,340
Go on.

744
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:43,431
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

745
01:06:45,643 --> 01:06:47,393
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

746
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:57,362
Mum sent me a dress.

747
01:06:57,529 --> 01:07:01,366
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

748
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:03,660
Nose down, Harry.

749
01:07:04,203 --> 01:07:08,164
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

750
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,709
What are you on about?

751
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:13,836
They're not for Ginny.

752
01:07:14,004 --> 01:07:15,380
They're for you.

753
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:20,134
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

754
01:07:21,387 --> 01:07:23,554
The Yule Ball...

755
01:07:23,722 --> 01:07:29,060
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

756
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,854
...since its inception.

757
01:07:32,523 --> 01:07:36,401
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

758
01:07:36,568 --> 01:07:38,236
...gather in the Great Hall...

759
01:07:38,404 --> 01:07:42,448
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

760
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,244
As representatives of the host school...

761
01:07:46,412 --> 01:07:51,541
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

762
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:54,460
And I mean this literally, because...

763
01:07:54,628 --> 01:07:59,090
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

764
01:07:59,925 --> 01:08:01,426
...a dance.

765
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,473
Silence!

766
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:10,685
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

767
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,479
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

768
01:08:13,647 --> 01:08:17,734
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

769
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:22,113
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

770
01:08:22,823 --> 01:08:24,782
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

771
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:26,451
Now, to dance...

772
01:08:26,618 --> 01:08:30,329
...is to let the body breathe.

773
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:33,833
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

774
01:08:34,001 --> 01:08:36,377
...longing to burst forth and take flight.

775
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:40,548
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

776
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:43,843
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

777
01:08:44,011 --> 01:08:46,262
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

778
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:48,848
Will you join me, please?

779
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:56,981
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

780
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:59,734
- Where?
- My waist.

781
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:02,487
And extend your arm.

782
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,864
Mr. Filch, if you please.

783
01:09:07,951 --> 01:09:09,952
One, two, three.

784
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:13,623
One, two, three. One, two, three.

785
01:09:17,336 --> 01:09:19,462
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

786
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:20,797
- Never.
- Never.

787
01:09:20,964 --> 01:09:24,842
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

788
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:49,867
Why do they have to travel in packs?

789
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:52,903
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

790
01:10:00,546 --> 01:10:04,048
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

791
01:10:04,216 --> 01:10:06,467
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

792
01:10:12,683 --> 01:10:14,225
I take after my mum.

793
01:10:14,393 --> 01:10:18,354
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

794
01:10:18,522 --> 01:10:20,439
No, not the maternal sort, apparently.

795
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:24,193
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

796
01:10:24,361 --> 01:10:28,906
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

797
01:10:29,074 --> 01:10:31,409
He laughed so hard at that.

798
01:10:33,453 --> 01:10:35,329
Very funny.

799
01:10:41,253 --> 01:10:45,006
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

800
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:48,217
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

801
01:10:48,635 --> 01:10:50,887
But enough of me. What about you?

802
01:11:12,587 --> 01:11:14,387
Hey Cho, hang on!

803
01:11:16,587 --> 01:11:17,587
- Cho!
- Hey, Harry!

804
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:18,787
- Hi, Harry.
- Hello.

805
01:11:18,887 --> 01:11:20,587
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi.

806
01:11:34,787 --> 01:11:37,087
Would you please come
to the ball with me?

807
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:39,887
Yes.

808
01:11:52,871 --> 01:11:57,959
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

809
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:02,964
Well, us and Neville.

810
01:12:03,132 --> 01:12:05,800
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

811
01:12:06,552 --> 01:12:09,887
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

812
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:14,100
Now I'm really depressed.

813
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,443
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

814
01:12:25,446 --> 01:12:27,447
Who you going with, then?

815
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,868
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

816
01:12:32,036 --> 01:12:37,331
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

817
01:12:37,666 --> 01:12:39,417
To the ball?

818
01:12:39,585 --> 01:12:41,044
Yeah, all right.

819
01:12:44,757 --> 01:12:46,299
Oi, Hermione.

820
01:12:46,467 --> 01:12:48,134
You're a girl.

821
01:12:48,302 --> 01:12:49,635
Very well spotted.

822
01:12:49,803 --> 01:12:51,721
Come with one of us?

823
01:12:56,351 --> 01:12:59,270
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

824
01:12:59,438 --> 01:13:00,938
For a girl, it's just sad.

825
01:13:01,106 --> 01:13:04,859
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

826
01:13:11,825 --> 01:13:13,826
And I said yes!

827
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:17,246
Bloody hell.

828
01:13:17,414 --> 01:13:19,082
She's lying, right?

829
01:13:19,249 --> 01:13:20,500
If you say so.

830
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:24,504
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

831
01:13:24,671 --> 01:13:28,549
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

832
01:13:28,717 --> 01:13:30,301
Agreed.

833
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,993
- Cho!
- Harry!

834
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,291
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

835
01:14:02,459 --> 01:14:04,043
Okay, thanks.

836
01:14:08,507 --> 01:14:09,549
Cho?

837
01:14:10,509 --> 01:14:12,051
Yes?

838
01:14:13,428 --> 01:14:15,680
Well, I just wondered if you...

839
01:14:15,848 --> 01:14:18,516
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

840
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:22,562
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

841
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:28,401
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

842
01:14:34,408 --> 01:14:35,992
Harry...

843
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,995
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

844
01:14:39,997 --> 01:14:41,414
And...

845
01:14:42,082 --> 01:14:45,334
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

846
01:14:47,004 --> 01:14:49,589
Okay. Yeah. Great.

847
01:14:50,883 --> 01:14:53,593
Fine. No problem.

848
01:14:53,927 --> 01:14:55,511
Okay. Good.

849
01:14:56,763 --> 01:14:58,514
Harry?

850
01:14:59,141 --> 01:15:00,933
I really am...

851
01:15:01,101 --> 01:15:02,768
...sorry.

852
01:15:12,529 --> 01:15:14,030
It's all right, Ron.

853
01:15:14,198 --> 01:15:17,408
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

854
01:15:17,576 --> 01:15:19,452
What happened to you?

855
01:15:19,703 --> 01:15:21,871
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

856
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:24,540
- What?
- What did she say?

857
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:26,083
No, of course.

858
01:15:27,628 --> 01:15:30,963
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

859
01:15:31,381 --> 01:15:35,801
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

860
01:15:36,553 --> 01:15:40,181
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

861
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:43,809
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

862
01:15:44,978 --> 01:15:48,606
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

863
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:52,485
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

864
01:15:52,653 --> 01:15:53,903
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

865
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:57,156
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

866
01:15:58,492 --> 01:16:01,035
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

867
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:02,662
Hey!

868
01:16:19,763 --> 01:16:25,476
Bloody hell.

869
01:16:28,981 --> 01:16:30,273
Bloody...

870
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,691
Oh, bloody...

871
01:16:35,362 --> 01:16:38,072
What are those? What are those?

872
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,284
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

873
01:16:41,451 --> 01:16:44,370
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

874
01:16:44,538 --> 01:16:46,497
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

875
01:16:46,665 --> 01:16:51,711
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

876
01:16:54,047 --> 01:16:57,133
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

877
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:03,723
Murder me, Harry.

878
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,684
Leave it alone!

879
01:17:07,644 --> 01:17:11,063
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

880
01:17:11,231 --> 01:17:13,733
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

881
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,486
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

882
01:17:17,654 --> 01:17:19,864
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

883
01:17:20,032 --> 01:17:25,119
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

884
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:27,496
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

885
01:17:27,664 --> 01:17:29,498
Don't you look...

886
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:31,250
...dashing.

887
01:17:31,835 --> 01:17:35,004
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

888
01:17:35,172 --> 01:17:37,006
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

889
01:17:37,174 --> 01:17:40,217
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

890
01:17:40,385 --> 01:17:41,427
...are the first to dance.

891
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:44,430
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

892
01:17:44,973 --> 01:17:46,724
Well, now you know.

893
01:17:48,226 --> 01:17:52,521
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

894
01:17:52,689 --> 01:17:55,107
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

895
01:17:55,275 --> 01:17:56,776
Come along this way.

896
01:18:01,615 --> 01:18:03,449
Oh, come on.

897
01:18:04,284 --> 01:18:06,285
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

898
01:18:06,453 --> 01:18:09,830
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

899
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:14,460
This way. This way. Come along.

900
01:18:16,129 --> 01:18:18,381
She looks beautiful!

901
01:18:18,548 --> 01:18:20,132
Yeah, she does.

902
01:19:07,514 --> 01:19:11,100
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

903
01:19:11,726 --> 01:19:14,311
No. Absolutely not.

904
01:19:19,025 --> 01:19:20,568
Hi!

905
01:19:29,327 --> 01:19:31,328
Harry, take my waist.

906
01:19:32,205 --> 01:19:33,622
- What?
- Now!

907
01:20:52,922 --> 01:20:54,222
Ladies and gentlemen.

908
01:20:54,422 --> 01:20:55,822
Your attention, please!

909
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:00,822
Sorry.

910
01:21:01,522 --> 01:21:02,822
Ladies and gentlemen.

911
01:21:03,722 --> 01:21:07,822
And for the first time
playing live here in Hogwarts...

912
01:21:08,022 --> 01:21:13,122
...please welcome
the band that needs no introduction!

913
01:21:13,922 --> 01:21:14,922
Lumus!

914
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,822
All right, Hogwarts!

915
01:21:18,922 --> 01:21:21,022
Are you ready for
some real music?

916
01:21:21,222 --> 01:21:22,222
Come on!

917
01:21:22,422 --> 01:21:24,522
I wanna see
your hands in the air!

918
01:21:26,722 --> 01:21:28,222
You're looking good!

919
01:21:29,322 --> 01:21:32,722
I'm gonna teach you
a brand new dance tonight!

920
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:38,066
Are you ready?

921
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:41,502
<i>Move your body like a hairy troll</i>

922
01:21:41,754 --> 01:21:44,213
<i>Learning to rock and roll</i>

923
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:47,516
<i>Spin around like a crazy elf</i>

924
01:21:47,718 --> 01:21:49,869
<i>Dancing by himself</i>

925
01:21:50,162 --> 01:21:53,198
<i>Boogie down like a unicorn</i>

926
01:21:53,466 --> 01:21:56,125
<i>No stopping till the break of dawn</i>

927
01:21:56,393 --> 01:21:59,128
<i>Put your hands up in the air</i>

928
01:21:59,496 --> 01:22:02,290
<i>Like an ogre who just don't care</i>

929
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,568
<i>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</i>

930
01:22:08,568 --> 01:22:11,168
<i>Flyin' off from a cliff</i>

931
01:22:13,868 --> 01:22:16,468
<i>Swooping down, to the ground</i>

932
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:23,268
<i>Wheel around and around
and around and around</i>

933
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:30,368
<i>Move around like a scary ghost</i>

934
01:22:30,568 --> 01:22:32,468
<i>Spooking himself the most</i>

935
01:22:32,968 --> 01:22:36,068
<i>Shake your booty like a boggart in pain</i>

936
01:22:36,268 --> 01:22:39,068
<i>Again and again and again</i>

937
01:22:39,268 --> 01:22:42,068
<i>Get it on like an angry specter</i>

938
01:22:42,268 --> 01:22:44,868
<i>Who's definitely out to get ya'</i>

939
01:22:45,068 --> 01:22:47,968
<i>Stamp your feet like a leprechaun</i>

940
01:22:48,268 --> 01:22:50,868
<i>Gettin' it on, gettin' it on</i>

941
01:22:51,168 --> 01:22:54,168
<i>Can you dance like a Hipogriff?</i>

942
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:58,573
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

943
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:04,162
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

944
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:07,623
May I have your arm?

945
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:10,543
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

946
01:23:17,343 --> 01:23:18,543
<i>Come on</i>

947
01:23:19,743 --> 01:23:21,243
<i>You gotta move it</i>

948
01:23:22,843 --> 01:23:25,243
<i>Like a groovy creature</i>

949
01:23:25,343 --> 01:23:27,543
<i>Creature of the night</i>

950
01:23:28,243 --> 01:23:30,143
<i>Yeah, that's right</i>

951
01:23:30,543 --> 01:23:32,943
<i>Ah, a creature of the night</i>

952
01:23:33,743 --> 01:23:35,343
<i>Well, do ya' feel alright?</i>

953
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,943
<i>Do ya' feel alright?</i>

954
01:23:48,843 --> 01:23:51,043
<i>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</i>

955
01:23:54,343 --> 01:23:57,143
<i>Flyin' off from a cliff</i>

956
01:24:00,043 --> 01:24:02,243
<i>Swooping down, to the ground</i>

957
01:24:05,243 --> 01:24:08,043
<i>Wheel around and around
and around and around</i>

958
01:24:13,643 --> 01:24:14,643
<i>Come on</i>

959
01:24:16,543 --> 01:24:17,543
<i>Come on</i>

960
01:24:19,343 --> 01:24:21,343
<i>Can you dance like a hippogriff?</i>

961
01:24:55,345 --> 01:24:56,929
Hot, isn't it?

962
01:24:57,597 --> 01:25:00,933
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

963
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:04,812
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

964
01:25:06,481 --> 01:25:08,816
What's got your wand in a knot?

965
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:12,820
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

966
01:25:12,987 --> 01:25:16,532
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

967
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:19,701
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

968
01:25:19,869 --> 01:25:23,372
...is international
magical cooperation...

969
01:25:23,957 --> 01:25:25,541
...to make friends.

970
01:25:26,209 --> 01:25:29,378
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

971
01:25:39,347 --> 01:25:41,682
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

972
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,267
No.

973
01:25:57,267 --> 01:25:58,367
Get on!

974
01:26:20,667 --> 01:26:22,867
It's happening again,
like before!

975
01:26:23,567 --> 01:26:26,667
Soon neither you or anyone else
will be able to deny it.

976
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:30,467
I told you already, Igor,
I see no reason to discuss it.

977
01:26:34,667 --> 01:26:35,767
Lumus!

978
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:38,967
10 points from Hufflepuff, Fawcett.

979
01:26:39,267 --> 01:26:41,567
And the same for Ravenclaw, Stebbins.

980
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:44,867
It's a sign, Severus!

981
01:26:44,967 --> 01:26:47,867
- You know it is!
- I don't know what you're talking about.

982
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:51,867
Really? Then perhaps you won't mind
rolling up your sleeve.

983
01:26:53,467 --> 01:26:55,867
You don't fool me, Severus!

984
01:26:57,067 --> 01:27:00,267
You are scared! Admit it!

985
01:27:01,667 --> 01:27:04,367
I have nothing to be scared of, Igor.

986
01:27:04,867 --> 01:27:07,167
Can you say the same?

987
01:27:30,226 --> 01:27:32,644
- He's using you.
- How dare you?

988
01:27:32,812 --> 01:27:37,023
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

989
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:40,861
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

990
01:27:41,028 --> 01:27:43,154
You know the solution then, don't you?

991
01:27:43,322 --> 01:27:45,323
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

992
01:27:45,491 --> 01:27:48,618
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

993
01:27:48,786 --> 01:27:50,829
And not as a last resort.

994
01:27:50,997 --> 01:27:55,208
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

995
01:27:55,376 --> 01:27:56,710
Harry.

996
01:27:57,169 --> 01:27:58,461
Where have you been?

997
01:27:58,629 --> 01:28:01,131
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

998
01:28:03,968 --> 01:28:07,971
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

999
01:28:08,139 --> 01:28:10,015
What's this about?

1000
01:28:14,312 --> 01:28:17,314
No, don't let

1001
01:28:19,108 --> 01:28:23,445
This magic die

1002
01:28:25,197 --> 01:28:27,991
The answer's there

1003
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,385
Let me see it again.

1004
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,639
Yes, the time is close now.

1005
01:29:37,311 --> 01:29:39,187
Harry, at last!

1006
01:29:40,481 --> 01:29:45,819
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

1007
01:29:56,414 --> 01:29:57,831
You all right, Harry?

1008
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:01,042
I just got in.

1009
01:30:01,627 --> 01:30:02,877
Me.

1010
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:17,434
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

1011
01:30:17,601 --> 01:30:21,771
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

1012
01:30:23,315 --> 01:30:25,108
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

1013
01:30:25,276 --> 01:30:28,111
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

1014
01:30:29,321 --> 01:30:33,950
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

1015
01:30:37,663 --> 01:30:40,874
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

1016
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:43,585
Mostly, he watches me study.

1017
01:30:44,378 --> 01:30:46,463
It's a bit annoying, actually.

1018
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,550
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

1019
01:30:51,385 --> 01:30:52,927
What's that supposed to mean?

1020
01:30:53,471 --> 01:30:56,473
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

1021
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,809
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

1022
01:31:00,978 --> 01:31:02,604
And...

1023
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,816
...I'm scared for you.

1024
01:31:07,777 --> 01:31:10,361
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

1025
01:31:10,988 --> 01:31:13,490
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

1026
01:31:13,657 --> 01:31:15,325
Hey, Potter!

1027
01:31:21,082 --> 01:31:22,582
- Potter!
- Cedric.

1028
01:31:25,294 --> 01:31:26,961
How...? How are you?

1029
01:31:28,005 --> 01:31:29,422
Spectacular.

1030
01:31:30,966 --> 01:31:34,803
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

1031
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:37,305
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

1032
01:31:37,598 --> 01:31:39,182
Exactly.

1033
01:31:40,267 --> 01:31:42,852
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

1034
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:49,275
It's not a bad place for a bath.

1035
01:31:51,654 --> 01:31:53,530
Just take your egg...

1036
01:31:54,281 --> 01:31:57,033
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

1037
01:32:32,236 --> 01:32:34,404
I must be out of my mind.

1038
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:46,749
I'm definitely out of my mind.

1039
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:52,714
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

1040
01:32:52,882 --> 01:32:54,757
Myrtle!

1041
01:32:54,925 --> 01:32:56,676
Hello, Harry.

1042
01:32:57,428 --> 01:33:00,680
Long time no see.

1043
01:33:04,935 --> 01:33:08,605
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

1044
01:33:08,772 --> 01:33:12,233
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

1045
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:14,736
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

1046
01:33:14,904 --> 01:33:16,654
Polyjuice Potion?

1047
01:33:17,448 --> 01:33:21,451
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

1048
01:33:28,292 --> 01:33:29,959
That's what he did.

1049
01:33:30,794 --> 01:33:32,462
The other boy...

1050
01:33:33,881 --> 01:33:35,965
...the handsome one...

1051
01:33:37,259 --> 01:33:38,468
...Cedric.

1052
01:33:41,889 --> 01:33:44,557
Well, go on. Open it.

1053
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:57,654
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

1054
01:33:57,821 --> 01:34:02,492
We cannot sing
Above the ground

1055
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:07,038
An hour long you'll have to look

1056
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:12,460
To recover what we took

1057
01:34:20,636 --> 01:34:21,844
Myrtle...

1058
01:34:23,514 --> 01:34:26,975
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

1059
01:34:27,851 --> 01:34:29,519
Very good.

1060
01:34:30,396 --> 01:34:34,774
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

1061
01:34:35,276 --> 01:34:39,028
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

1062
01:34:56,714 --> 01:34:58,715
Harry, tell me again.

1063
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:03,219
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

1064
01:35:03,387 --> 01:35:05,972
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

1065
01:35:06,932 --> 01:35:09,475
"An hour long you'll have to look."

1066
01:35:09,643 --> 01:35:13,104
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

1067
01:35:14,481 --> 01:35:16,357
"Potentially problematic"?

1068
01:35:16,525 --> 01:35:19,777
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1069
01:35:20,321 --> 01:35:24,657
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1070
01:35:24,825 --> 01:35:27,327
Hate to break up the skull session.

1071
01:35:27,494 --> 01:35:29,495
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1072
01:35:29,747 --> 01:35:32,123
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1073
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:34,959
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1074
01:35:35,127 --> 01:35:37,754
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1075
01:35:37,921 --> 01:35:39,756
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1076
01:35:39,923 --> 01:35:42,425
Go. Now!

1077
01:35:52,436 --> 01:35:54,228
Longbottom!

1078
01:35:54,396 --> 01:35:56,439
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1079
01:36:05,074 --> 01:36:07,283
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1080
01:36:07,451 --> 01:36:10,036
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1081
01:36:10,621 --> 01:36:14,957
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1082
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:18,878
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1083
01:36:19,463 --> 01:36:21,214
...about plants.

1084
01:36:21,548 --> 01:36:23,257
Now, if there's...

1085
01:36:23,425 --> 01:36:28,221
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1086
01:36:28,389 --> 01:36:30,890
...then great. But otherwise...

1087
01:36:31,058 --> 01:36:34,852
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1088
01:36:36,188 --> 01:36:38,940
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1089
01:36:39,108 --> 01:36:40,566
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1090
01:36:40,734 --> 01:36:42,151
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1091
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:44,487
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1092
01:36:44,655 --> 01:36:46,197
Don't be so mean.

1093
01:36:46,824 --> 01:36:48,658
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1094
01:36:50,828 --> 01:36:52,829
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1095
01:36:52,996 --> 01:36:54,914
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1096
01:36:55,082 --> 01:36:56,582
Most likely?

1097
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:58,960
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1098
01:36:59,128 --> 01:37:01,587
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1099
01:37:01,755 --> 01:37:04,424
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1100
01:37:04,591 --> 01:37:06,551
I just wanted to help.

1101
01:37:06,718 --> 01:37:09,846
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1102
01:37:10,013 --> 01:37:11,764
Where are they anyway?

1103
01:37:11,932 --> 01:37:14,976
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1104
01:37:21,984 --> 01:37:24,193
Welcome to the second task.

1105
01:37:24,361 --> 01:37:28,072
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1106
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,615
A treasure of sorts.

1107
01:37:29,783 --> 01:37:32,410
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1108
01:37:32,578 --> 01:37:35,288
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1109
01:37:35,456 --> 01:37:37,039
In order to win...

1110
01:37:37,207 --> 01:37:41,043
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1111
01:37:41,211 --> 01:37:43,838
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1112
01:37:44,006 --> 01:37:47,633
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1113
01:37:47,801 --> 01:37:51,721
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1114
01:37:52,222 --> 01:37:54,474
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1115
01:38:21,001 --> 01:38:23,920
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1116
01:38:25,255 --> 01:38:28,257
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1117
01:38:30,093 --> 01:38:32,011
Yeah!

1118
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,805
What?

1119
01:39:54,386 --> 01:39:56,512
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1120
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,223
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1121
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:02,977
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1122
01:41:20,764 --> 01:41:22,598
But she's my friend too!

1123
01:41:24,184 --> 01:41:25,935
Only one!

1124
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:19,155
Let's get down below.

1125
01:42:29,124 --> 01:42:32,001
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1126
01:43:29,518 --> 01:43:31,227
Yes!

1127
01:43:49,371 --> 01:43:51,413
Ascendio!

1128
01:43:56,670 --> 01:43:58,379
Harry!

1129
01:44:00,674 --> 01:44:02,132
He's all right.

1130
01:44:03,343 --> 01:44:04,760
He's all right. Barty!

1131
01:44:04,928 --> 01:44:08,389
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1132
01:44:08,974 --> 01:44:12,476
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1133
01:44:13,103 --> 01:44:14,812
My little sister.

1134
01:44:15,230 --> 01:44:16,772
Thank you.

1135
01:44:17,607 --> 01:44:20,317
And you! You helped.

1136
01:44:20,944 --> 01:44:23,988
Well, yeah, a bit.

1137
01:44:31,204 --> 01:44:32,371
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1138
01:44:32,539 --> 01:44:35,207
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1139
01:44:36,459 --> 01:44:38,377
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1140
01:44:38,545 --> 01:44:40,588
I finished last, Hermione.

1141
01:44:41,423 --> 01:44:45,551
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1142
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:48,971
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1143
01:44:49,139 --> 01:44:52,016
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1144
01:44:54,352 --> 01:44:56,979
Attention!

1145
01:44:57,439 --> 01:45:01,317
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1146
01:45:01,735 --> 01:45:05,237
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1147
01:45:05,405 --> 01:45:08,073
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1148
01:45:08,241 --> 01:45:13,203
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1149
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:17,666
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1150
01:45:17,834 --> 01:45:19,835
...second place...

1151
01:45:20,003 --> 01:45:21,503
- Second place!
- Well done!

1152
01:45:21,671 --> 01:45:24,298
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1153
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:27,092
Yes!

1154
01:45:30,722 --> 01:45:32,389
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1155
01:45:32,557 --> 01:45:34,183
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1156
01:45:34,351 --> 01:45:36,727
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1157
01:45:36,895 --> 01:45:39,563
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1158
01:45:39,731 --> 01:45:41,398
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1159
01:45:41,566 --> 01:45:43,108
Well done, boy.

1160
01:45:43,276 --> 01:45:46,528
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1161
01:45:46,696 --> 01:45:50,699
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1162
01:45:51,701 --> 01:45:55,162
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1163
01:45:55,330 --> 01:45:57,331
...to lose one's family.

1164
01:45:59,334 --> 01:46:01,502
Never whole again, are we?

1165
01:46:03,713 --> 01:46:05,839
Still, life goes on...

1166
01:46:06,508 --> 01:46:08,175
...and here we stand.

1167
01:46:11,054 --> 01:46:13,764
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1168
01:46:13,932 --> 01:46:15,391
Bartemius!

1169
01:46:15,558 --> 01:46:19,728
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1170
01:46:19,896 --> 01:46:23,065
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1171
01:46:35,578 --> 01:46:37,454
And they say I'm mad.

1172
01:46:53,654 --> 01:46:54,754
If you want to play the hero...

1173
01:46:54,854 --> 01:46:56,854
...I can find you plenty playmates
among the first year's.

1174
01:46:56,954 --> 01:47:00,054
Otherwise, I suggest you grow up,
and grow up fast.

1175
01:47:00,254 --> 01:47:02,654
There are worse than
mermaids ahead of you.

1176
01:47:02,854 --> 01:47:04,454
We can win this.

1177
01:47:17,756 --> 01:47:21,467
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1178
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:24,679
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1179
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:27,765
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1180
01:47:27,933 --> 01:47:31,936
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1181
01:47:32,104 --> 01:47:35,440
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1182
01:47:35,607 --> 01:47:37,191
And Harry, of course.

1183
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:42,739
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1184
01:47:42,948 --> 01:47:44,949
Hooray!

1185
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:48,911
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1186
01:47:49,079 --> 01:47:51,706
Teach us something, please

1187
01:48:01,675 --> 01:48:03,176
Mr. Crouch?

1188
01:48:10,576 --> 01:48:12,376
They'll cover this up, you watch.

1189
01:48:12,776 --> 01:48:16,076
Fudge will sell his soul before
this gets out in the Daily Prophet.

1190
01:48:16,276 --> 01:48:17,476
Why?

1191
01:48:17,676 --> 01:48:19,776
Look, nobody liked Crouch.

1192
01:48:19,876 --> 01:48:21,676
I know this from my father.

1193
01:48:21,976 --> 01:48:23,976
A bunch of people
wanted him dead.

1194
01:48:24,176 --> 01:48:26,676
But he was a Ministry official.

1195
01:48:27,276 --> 01:48:30,776
It's not even like he turned up stiff
in Knockturn Alley.

1196
01:48:30,976 --> 01:48:33,376
He was murdered at Hogwarts.

1197
01:48:33,676 --> 01:48:35,476
This is a big deal.

1198
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:37,776
Can't be coincidence.

1199
01:48:38,376 --> 01:48:40,776
Harry's dreams, his scar hurting...

1200
01:48:41,176 --> 01:48:45,176
...the dark mark, his name
coming out of the Goblet of Fire.

1201
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:50,276
Surviving the tournament isn't
the answer anymore, Harry.

1202
01:48:50,876 --> 01:48:52,476
It's bigger than this.

1203
01:48:53,476 --> 01:48:55,776
And I really think
you should go to Dumbledore.

1204
01:48:55,976 --> 01:48:57,476
Yeah.

1205
01:49:08,367 --> 01:49:11,953
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1206
01:49:12,121 --> 01:49:13,705
I will not.

1207
01:49:13,873 --> 01:49:17,917
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1208
01:49:18,085 --> 01:49:19,419
Then for once show them some!

1209
01:49:19,587 --> 01:49:23,715
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1210
01:49:23,883 --> 01:49:27,093
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1211
01:49:27,261 --> 01:49:30,054
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1212
01:49:30,222 --> 01:49:33,892
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1213
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:39,772
Oh, Harry!

1214
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:42,275
Harry, how good to see you again.

1215
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:44,611
I can come back later, professor.

1216
01:49:44,778 --> 01:49:48,114
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1217
01:49:48,282 --> 01:49:50,867
Minister, after you.

1218
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:53,411
There you are. Your hat.

1219
01:49:53,579 --> 01:49:57,248
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1220
01:49:57,416 --> 01:50:00,627
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1221
01:51:32,052 --> 01:51:33,678
Professor?

1222
01:51:33,846 --> 01:51:36,389
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1223
01:51:47,276 --> 01:51:51,070
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1224
01:51:51,238 --> 01:51:53,156
...to present evidence to this council.

1225
01:51:53,324 --> 01:51:56,034
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1226
01:51:56,201 --> 01:52:00,246
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1227
01:52:00,414 --> 01:52:05,043
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1228
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:06,919
Do you accept these terms?

1229
01:52:07,463 --> 01:52:10,173
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1230
01:52:10,507 --> 01:52:12,967
I have names, sir.

1231
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:17,096
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1232
01:52:19,767 --> 01:52:22,310
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1233
01:52:22,478 --> 01:52:24,604
- ...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1234
01:52:24,772 --> 01:52:27,440
- If that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1235
01:52:27,608 --> 01:52:30,902
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1236
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:33,446
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1237
01:52:33,614 --> 01:52:34,739
Yeah, the same.

1238
01:52:34,907 --> 01:52:38,618
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1239
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:43,122
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1240
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:45,291
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1241
01:52:45,459 --> 01:52:50,171
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1242
01:52:50,339 --> 01:52:53,299
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1243
01:52:53,467 --> 01:52:57,470
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1244
01:52:57,638 --> 01:53:00,640
- ...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1245
01:53:00,808 --> 01:53:04,227
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1246
01:53:04,395 --> 01:53:06,687
Silence!

1247
01:53:07,314 --> 01:53:10,733
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1248
01:53:10,901 --> 01:53:13,027
...this session is now concluded.

1249
01:53:13,195 --> 01:53:15,321
Oh, no, no, no.

1250
01:53:16,198 --> 01:53:17,657
I've heard about one more.

1251
01:53:17,825 --> 01:53:20,410
- What's that?
- The name.

1252
01:53:20,577 --> 01:53:22,036
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1253
01:53:22,204 --> 01:53:24,247
...this person took part
in the capture...

1254
01:53:24,415 --> 01:53:26,582
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1255
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:30,253
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1256
01:53:30,421 --> 01:53:32,755
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1257
01:53:32,923 --> 01:53:35,466
Barty Crouch...

1258
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:39,178
...Junior.

1259
01:53:48,689 --> 01:53:50,356
Hold him down!

1260
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:57,655
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1261
01:53:59,366 --> 01:54:00,950
Hello, Father.

1262
01:54:02,369 --> 01:54:04,412
You are no son of mine.

1263
01:54:15,716 --> 01:54:20,219
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1264
01:54:21,555 --> 01:54:22,972
It's a Pensieve.

1265
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:27,810
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1266
01:54:27,978 --> 01:54:31,522
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1267
01:54:31,982 --> 01:54:34,942
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1268
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:36,694
...some small detail...

1269
01:54:38,071 --> 01:54:40,239
...something I might have overlooked...

1270
01:54:40,407 --> 01:54:44,577
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1271
01:54:45,412 --> 01:54:49,248
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1272
01:54:50,334 --> 01:54:51,918
It's maddening.

1273
01:54:54,254 --> 01:54:56,047
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1274
01:54:56,798 --> 01:54:58,883
What exactly happened to him?

1275
01:54:59,051 --> 01:55:03,846
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1276
01:55:04,515 --> 01:55:08,100
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1277
01:55:09,603 --> 01:55:12,605
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1278
01:55:13,315 --> 01:55:15,441
I had a dream about him.

1279
01:55:17,694 --> 01:55:20,488
It was in the summer, before school.

1280
01:55:22,616 --> 01:55:25,618
In the dream, I was in a house.

1281
01:55:25,827 --> 01:55:30,623
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1282
01:55:30,791 --> 01:55:34,418
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1283
01:55:34,795 --> 01:55:37,630
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1284
01:55:38,465 --> 01:55:40,091
Always the same one.

1285
01:55:43,136 --> 01:55:45,471
Sir, these dreams...

1286
01:55:45,639 --> 01:55:50,810
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1287
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:55,439
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1288
01:55:55,941 --> 01:55:57,900
I think it's best if you simply...

1289
01:56:03,532 --> 01:56:05,324
...cast them away.

1290
01:56:14,585 --> 01:56:18,546
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1291
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,472
Potter!

1292
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:31,183
What's your hurry?

1293
01:56:36,273 --> 01:56:40,026
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1294
01:56:40,193 --> 01:56:42,486
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1295
01:56:43,238 --> 01:56:44,780
Yes, sir.

1296
01:56:45,699 --> 01:56:47,116
Ingenious.

1297
01:56:48,952 --> 01:56:52,913
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1298
01:56:53,707 --> 01:56:57,209
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1299
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,880
Nor is this.

1300
01:57:05,052 --> 01:57:06,719
Know what it is?

1301
01:57:08,055 --> 01:57:09,472
Bubble juice, sir?

1302
01:57:10,057 --> 01:57:11,932
Veritaserum.

1303
01:57:12,684 --> 01:57:16,395
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1304
01:57:16,563 --> 01:57:21,734
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1305
01:57:22,402 --> 01:57:25,404
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1306
01:57:25,572 --> 01:57:30,451
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1307
01:57:30,619 --> 01:57:35,039
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1308
01:57:36,166 --> 01:57:41,879
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1309
01:57:42,589 --> 01:57:45,925
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1310
01:57:46,093 --> 01:57:48,260
...I'm going to find out why!

1311
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,560
What do you suppose
is on Karkaroff's arm?

1312
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:53,860
I don't know.

1313
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:55,960
Boomslang skin and lacewing flies?

1314
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,660
Are you sure those are
the two ingredients Snape mentioned?

1315
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:00,460
Positive, why?

1316
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:03,860
Well, he thinks we are broiling
Polyjuice Potion, doesn't he?

1317
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,460
I don't care what Snape thinks.

1318
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,560
I got bigger problems than detention.

1319
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,260
Someone's coming closer.

1320
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:12,860
I can feel it.

1321
01:58:43,222 --> 01:58:44,806
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1322
01:59:03,992 --> 01:59:05,535
Sonorus!

1323
01:59:09,748 --> 01:59:15,086
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1324
01:59:15,254 --> 01:59:20,258
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1325
01:59:22,344 --> 01:59:24,136
...and Mr. Potter...

1326
01:59:26,014 --> 01:59:27,765
...are tied for first position...

1327
01:59:27,933 --> 01:59:32,061
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1328
01:59:33,272 --> 01:59:36,774
- ...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1329
01:59:37,609 --> 01:59:40,736
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1330
01:59:45,075 --> 01:59:47,785
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1331
01:59:47,953 --> 01:59:50,913
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1332
01:59:51,081 --> 01:59:55,585
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1333
01:59:55,919 --> 01:59:59,797
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1334
02:00:02,968 --> 02:00:07,305
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1335
02:00:07,472 --> 02:00:10,808
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1336
02:00:10,976 --> 02:00:14,020
You see, people change in the maze.

1337
02:00:14,187 --> 02:00:15,897
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1338
02:00:16,064 --> 02:00:20,818
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1339
02:00:22,321 --> 02:00:25,323
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1340
02:00:34,333 --> 02:00:35,833
Good luck.

1341
02:00:36,209 --> 02:00:38,169
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1342
02:00:40,505 --> 02:00:43,132
On the count of three. One...

1343
02:04:10,882 --> 02:04:12,133
Fleur?

1344
02:04:13,802 --> 02:04:15,219
Fleur.

1345
02:04:18,807 --> 02:04:20,641
Periculum!

1346
02:04:59,306 --> 02:05:03,100
Get down!

1347
02:05:03,727 --> 02:05:04,935
Expelliarmus!

1348
02:05:14,571 --> 02:05:17,781
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1349
02:05:17,949 --> 02:05:19,992
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1350
02:05:31,630 --> 02:05:33,297
Yes.

1351
02:05:54,194 --> 02:06:07,790
Harry!

1352
02:06:09,751 --> 02:06:11,543
Reducto!

1353
02:06:28,353 --> 02:06:30,854
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1354
02:06:31,231 --> 02:06:35,943
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1355
02:06:36,111 --> 02:06:37,861
For a moment, so did I.

1356
02:06:39,698 --> 02:06:40,864
Some game, huh?

1357
02:06:41,908 --> 02:06:43,325
Some game.

1358
02:06:48,748 --> 02:06:50,374
Go!

1359
02:07:00,552 --> 02:07:03,554
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1360
02:07:03,722 --> 02:07:05,723
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1361
02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:07,141
- ...three!
- ...three!

1362
02:07:19,571 --> 02:07:22,531
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1363
02:07:29,581 --> 02:07:30,914
Where are we?

1364
02:07:36,629 --> 02:07:38,255
I've been here before.

1365
02:07:41,926 --> 02:07:43,510
It's a Portkey.

1366
02:07:45,263 --> 02:07:49,558
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1367
02:07:51,603 --> 02:07:55,022
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1368
02:07:55,190 --> 02:07:57,149
What are you talking about?

1369
02:08:02,405 --> 02:08:05,282
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1370
02:08:12,957 --> 02:08:15,292
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1371
02:08:15,460 --> 02:08:18,212
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1372
02:08:29,516 --> 02:08:31,392
Do it! Now!

1373
02:08:43,321 --> 02:08:45,823
Bone of the father...

1374
02:08:45,990 --> 02:08:48,325
...unwillingly given.

1375
02:08:55,792 --> 02:08:58,836
Flesh of the servant...

1376
02:09:00,839 --> 02:09:04,007
...willingly sacrificed.

1377
02:09:08,138 --> 02:09:11,849
And blood of the enemy...

1378
02:09:17,689 --> 02:09:20,190
...forcibly taken.

1379
02:09:26,197 --> 02:09:29,199
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1380
02:09:29,951 --> 02:09:31,869
...again.

1381
02:10:35,266 --> 02:10:38,685
My wand, Wormtail.

1382
02:10:48,238 --> 02:10:50,197
Hold out your arm.

1383
02:10:50,365 --> 02:10:51,949
Master.

1384
02:10:52,116 --> 02:10:54,785
Thank you, master.

1385
02:10:54,953 --> 02:10:56,411
The other arm, Wormtail.

1386
02:11:37,036 --> 02:11:38,954
Welcome, my friends.

1387
02:11:40,331 --> 02:11:43,125
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1388
02:11:43,751 --> 02:11:49,256
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1389
02:11:50,174 --> 02:11:53,135
I confess myself...

1390
02:11:53,595 --> 02:11:55,178
...disappointed.

1391
02:11:55,847 --> 02:11:57,931
Not one of you tried to find me.

1392
02:11:58,099 --> 02:12:01,476
Crabbe! Macnair!

1393
02:12:02,353 --> 02:12:03,687
Goyle!

1394
02:12:06,190 --> 02:12:07,858
Not even you...

1395
02:12:11,696 --> 02:12:13,655
...Lucius.

1396
02:12:15,491 --> 02:12:20,329
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1397
02:12:20,496 --> 02:12:23,498
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1398
02:12:23,666 --> 02:12:28,837
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1399
02:12:30,548 --> 02:12:36,178
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1400
02:12:38,181 --> 02:12:40,807
...that is my true mask.

1401
02:12:41,184 --> 02:12:42,726
I returned.

1402
02:12:45,229 --> 02:12:49,107
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1403
02:12:50,234 --> 02:12:56,031
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1404
02:13:01,245 --> 02:13:03,580
Thank you, master.

1405
02:13:04,165 --> 02:13:05,916
Thank you.

1406
02:13:09,003 --> 02:13:11,380
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1407
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:14,341
Harry.

1408
02:13:14,509 --> 02:13:17,302
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1409
02:13:17,470 --> 02:13:21,890
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1410
02:13:22,058 --> 02:13:23,433
I'd introduce you...

1411
02:13:23,601 --> 02:13:27,896
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1412
02:13:30,566 --> 02:13:33,235
The boy who lived.

1413
02:13:33,403 --> 02:13:36,279
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1414
02:13:36,447 --> 02:13:40,450
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1415
02:13:40,618 --> 02:13:45,372
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1416
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:47,124
Yes, shall I?

1417
02:13:47,458 --> 02:13:48,792
It was love.

1418
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:53,463
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1419
02:13:53,631 --> 02:13:56,258
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1420
02:13:56,634 --> 02:13:58,468
I could not touch him.

1421
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:01,805
It was old magic.

1422
02:14:01,973 --> 02:14:04,266
Something I should have foreseen.

1423
02:14:04,434 --> 02:14:06,226
But no matter, no matter.

1424
02:14:06,394 --> 02:14:08,603
Things have changed.

1425
02:14:09,355 --> 02:14:12,858
I can touch you...

1426
02:14:13,484 --> 02:14:15,193
...now.

1427
02:14:23,327 --> 02:14:24,661
Yeah.

1428
02:14:31,002 --> 02:14:34,713
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1429
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:37,591
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1430
02:14:39,177 --> 02:14:41,428
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1431
02:14:43,014 --> 02:14:45,348
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1432
02:14:45,516 --> 02:14:47,934
First, we bow to each other.

1433
02:14:48,102 --> 02:14:50,479
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1434
02:14:50,646 --> 02:14:53,857
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1435
02:14:54,025 --> 02:14:55,358
I said, bow.

1436
02:14:57,236 --> 02:15:01,573
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1437
02:15:01,991 --> 02:15:08,038
Crucio!

1438
02:15:09,123 --> 02:15:11,041
Attaboy, Harry.

1439
02:15:11,209 --> 02:15:13,376
Your parents would be proud.

1440
02:15:13,669 --> 02:15:17,047
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1441
02:15:17,215 --> 02:15:18,840
Expelliar...

1442
02:15:21,844 --> 02:15:24,221
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1443
02:15:24,388 --> 02:15:26,389
I'm going to destroy you.

1444
02:15:28,601 --> 02:15:34,189
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1445
02:15:34,816 --> 02:15:37,400
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1446
02:15:37,568 --> 02:15:40,237
...they'll speak only of how you...

1447
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:42,364
...begged for death.

1448
02:15:42,532 --> 02:15:46,284
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1449
02:15:46,828 --> 02:15:48,411
...obliged.

1450
02:15:48,746 --> 02:15:50,247
Get up!

1451
02:15:55,253 --> 02:15:57,254
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1452
02:15:57,421 --> 02:15:59,673
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1453
02:15:59,841 --> 02:16:03,051
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1454
02:16:16,983 --> 02:16:18,733
Have it your way.

1455
02:16:19,777 --> 02:16:22,153
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1456
02:16:39,672 --> 02:16:42,340
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1457
02:16:46,929 --> 02:16:48,638
He's mine!

1458
02:17:21,672 --> 02:17:25,675
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1459
02:17:25,843 --> 02:17:27,928
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1460
02:17:28,095 --> 02:17:29,846
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1461
02:17:31,057 --> 02:17:34,100
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1462
02:17:34,268 --> 02:17:36,811
Take my body back to my father.

1463
02:17:37,855 --> 02:17:39,189
Let go.

1464
02:17:39,649 --> 02:17:41,608
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1465
02:17:42,443 --> 02:17:45,070
Let go! Let go!

1466
02:17:50,826 --> 02:17:52,202
Accio!

1467
02:17:57,875 --> 02:17:59,876
No!

1468
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:14,224
He did it!

1469
02:18:15,476 --> 02:18:21,398
Harry!

1470
02:18:22,608 --> 02:18:25,860
No! No! No, don't!

1471
02:18:26,153 --> 02:18:28,029
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1472
02:18:28,322 --> 02:18:30,907
He's back. He's back.

1473
02:18:31,075 --> 02:18:33,076
Voldemort's back.

1474
02:18:33,244 --> 02:18:35,662
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1475
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:38,164
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1476
02:18:38,332 --> 02:18:41,126
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1477
02:18:41,293 --> 02:18:43,586
He's home. You both are.

1478
02:18:43,754 --> 02:18:47,424
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1479
02:18:50,469 --> 02:18:54,139
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1480
02:18:54,432 --> 02:18:56,099
Let me through.

1481
02:18:56,267 --> 02:19:00,979
Let me through!

1482
02:19:01,147 --> 02:19:02,564
That's my son!

1483
02:19:03,858 --> 02:19:05,275
That's my boy!

1484
02:19:08,112 --> 02:19:10,864
It's my boy!

1485
02:19:13,659 --> 02:19:17,245
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1486
02:19:17,413 --> 02:19:20,373
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1487
02:19:21,042 --> 02:19:23,251
No!

1488
02:19:26,297 --> 02:19:28,715
It's all right, I got you.

1489
02:19:28,883 --> 02:19:32,218
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1490
02:19:36,223 --> 02:19:40,977
No!

1491
02:20:23,395 --> 02:20:25,105
Are you all right, Potter?

1492
02:20:25,689 --> 02:20:27,607
Does it hurt? That?

1493
02:20:27,775 --> 02:20:29,567
Not so much now.

1494
02:20:30,528 --> 02:20:32,612
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1495
02:20:35,741 --> 02:20:37,742
The cup was a Portkey.

1496
02:20:40,454 --> 02:20:42,288
Someone had bewitched it.

1497
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:44,666
What was it like?

1498
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,668
- What was he like?
- Who?

1499
02:20:46,836 --> 02:20:48,586
The Dark Lord.

1500
02:20:50,881 --> 02:20:54,008
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1501
02:20:55,261 --> 02:20:57,053
I don't know.

1502
02:20:59,890 --> 02:21:02,851
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1503
02:21:05,813 --> 02:21:07,814
...into one of my nightmares.

1504
02:21:26,542 --> 02:21:28,084
Were there others?

1505
02:21:28,252 --> 02:21:30,545
In the graveyard, were there others?

1506
02:21:34,466 --> 02:21:35,884
I...

1507
02:21:36,594 --> 02:21:40,513
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1508
02:21:47,938 --> 02:21:51,232
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1509
02:21:55,613 --> 02:21:58,698
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1510
02:21:58,866 --> 02:22:00,783
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1511
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:07,999
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1512
02:22:08,167 --> 02:22:10,668
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1513
02:22:12,296 --> 02:22:14,964
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1514
02:22:15,132 --> 02:22:18,301
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1515
02:22:18,469 --> 02:22:20,053
...that led him straight to it?

1516
02:22:28,479 --> 02:22:32,482
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1517
02:22:33,025 --> 02:22:36,653
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1518
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:38,988
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1519
02:22:39,657 --> 02:22:43,159
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1520
02:22:43,327 --> 02:22:44,619
And now the deed is done.

1521
02:22:46,288 --> 02:22:50,625
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1522
02:22:59,134 --> 02:23:02,637
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1523
02:23:03,555 --> 02:23:06,057
...that I have once and for all...

1524
02:23:06,684 --> 02:23:11,020
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1525
02:23:11,188 --> 02:23:12,438
Expelliarmus!

1526
02:23:17,152 --> 02:23:18,403
Severus.

1527
02:23:20,864 --> 02:23:22,365
That's it, take it.

1528
02:23:24,368 --> 02:23:27,829
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1529
02:23:27,997 --> 02:23:30,707
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1530
02:23:30,874 --> 02:23:33,960
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1531
02:23:37,006 --> 02:23:38,548
Harry, away from there!

1532
02:23:59,528 --> 02:24:02,864
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1533
02:24:03,824 --> 02:24:05,908
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1534
02:24:07,703 --> 02:24:08,786
Polyjuice Potion.

1535
02:24:08,954 --> 02:24:12,206
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1536
02:24:12,416 --> 02:24:14,375
We'll get you up in a minute.

1537
02:24:48,786 --> 02:24:50,203
Harry!

1538
02:24:53,874 --> 02:24:56,084
Barty Crouch Junior.

1539
02:24:56,293 --> 02:24:59,253
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1540
02:25:01,632 --> 02:25:02,799
Your arm, Harry.

1541
02:25:07,179 --> 02:25:09,430
You know what this means, don't you?

1542
02:25:10,307 --> 02:25:11,641
He's back.

1543
02:25:12,851 --> 02:25:14,977
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1544
02:25:15,938 --> 02:25:18,272
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1545
02:25:18,482 --> 02:25:22,985
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1546
02:25:23,487 --> 02:25:25,988
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1547
02:25:26,532 --> 02:25:29,409
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1548
02:25:49,304 --> 02:25:51,973
Today, we acknowledge...

1549
02:25:52,683 --> 02:25:55,435
...a really terrible loss.

1550
02:25:57,521 --> 02:26:00,314
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1551
02:26:00,482 --> 02:26:02,817
...exceptionally hard-working...

1552
02:26:03,694 --> 02:26:06,070
...infinitely fair-minded...

1553
02:26:06,655 --> 02:26:08,948
...and, most importantly...

1554
02:26:09,241 --> 02:26:13,828
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1555
02:26:14,955 --> 02:26:19,333
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1556
02:26:22,379 --> 02:26:23,880
You see...

1557
02:26:24,715 --> 02:26:26,841
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1558
02:26:27,718 --> 02:26:29,719
...by Lord Voldemort!

1559
02:26:31,638 --> 02:26:35,224
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1560
02:26:35,851 --> 02:26:39,562
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1561
02:26:41,732 --> 02:26:43,399
Now, the pain...

1562
02:26:43,567 --> 02:26:47,236
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1563
02:26:47,404 --> 02:26:48,738
...and reminds us...

1564
02:26:48,906 --> 02:26:52,575
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1565
02:26:52,743 --> 02:26:56,204
...our hearts beat as one.

1566
02:26:56,705 --> 02:26:58,748
In light of recent events...

1567
02:26:59,082 --> 02:27:04,003
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1568
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:10,218
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1569
02:27:10,636 --> 02:27:12,762
You remember that...

1570
02:27:13,388 --> 02:27:16,432
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1571
02:27:16,934 --> 02:27:19,435
...kind and honest...

1572
02:27:19,937 --> 02:27:24,524
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1573
02:27:49,758 --> 02:27:51,801
I never liked these curtains.

1574
02:27:52,386 --> 02:27:55,054
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1575
02:27:55,389 --> 02:27:57,223
By accident, of course.

1576
02:28:02,896 --> 02:28:07,275
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1577
02:28:10,654 --> 02:28:12,363
Professor...

1578
02:28:12,573 --> 02:28:15,575
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1579
02:28:16,368 --> 02:28:20,788
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1580
02:28:22,332 --> 02:28:24,667
Priori Incantatem.

1581
02:28:28,839 --> 02:28:31,549
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1582
02:28:32,134 --> 02:28:33,968
They reappeared.

1583
02:28:35,429 --> 02:28:39,181
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1584
02:28:41,768 --> 02:28:44,353
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1585
02:28:44,855 --> 02:28:49,692
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1586
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:54,697
But remember this:

1587
02:28:54,865 --> 02:28:56,824
You have friends here.

1588
02:28:58,827 --> 02:29:00,578
You're not alone.

1589
02:29:21,266 --> 02:29:23,017
Hermione.

1590
02:29:23,393 --> 02:29:25,394
This is for you.

1591
02:29:26,021 --> 02:29:28,230
Write to me. Promise.

1592
02:29:29,316 --> 02:29:30,733
Bye.

1593
02:29:36,948 --> 02:29:38,908
Au revoir, Ron.

1594
02:30:22,828 --> 02:30:25,371
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1595
02:30:25,539 --> 02:30:26,664
- No.
- No.

1596
02:30:26,832 --> 02:30:31,210
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1597
02:30:35,632 --> 02:30:38,467
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1598
02:30:45,767 --> 02:30:47,226
Yes.

1599
02:30:51,982 --> 02:30:55,276
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1600
02:30:55,444 --> 02:30:57,987
I won't. You know I won't.

1601
02:30:59,281 --> 02:31:03,033
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
