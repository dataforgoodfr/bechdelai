### Installing pre-commit

To install `pre-commit`, you can use these command lines at the root of this repo:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Then when you'll use `git commit` it will automatically run the following checks : [BechdelAI pre-commit hooks](pre-commit-hooks.md).

**Important**: if a file is updated by one hook you need to add it again before reusing `git commit`.

More details in the [`pre-commit` documentation](https://pre-commit.com/)

### Golden rules & best practices
- Use type annotations as much as possible (see tutorial [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/type-annotations-in-python-d90990b172dc))
- Use Google style docstrings (you can use Visual Studio Code extension)
- Documentation of all functions and classes is done using mkdocstrings https://mkdocstrings.github.io/usage/
